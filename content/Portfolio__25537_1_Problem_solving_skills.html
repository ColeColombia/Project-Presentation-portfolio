 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>Situation</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Applications development practice 3, a subject in my 3rd year of study. We were assigned an assignment to select a problem to solve. The selected problem had to be analysed if it is feasible. The assignment was a group project of 6 team members.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">We decided to solve a problem in the health care industry. The importance of the assignment was to test our knowledge on Domain Driven Design, short for DDD, a software approach used to solve software engineering problems in a specific sphere of knowledge. In this instance the sphere of knowledge was the health care industry.&nbsp;</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Task</span></span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">We were tasked with selecting a specific problem in any industry and solve it using domain driven design approach. Each team member was given a specific part of the problem to reaserch and implement a possible solution. </span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The problem we selected was the appointment of a hospital appointment system. My task was to design the parts of the system which included the employee and the department of the employee as shown on artifact <em>Hospital Appointment Application Employment and Department UI </em>.</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Action</span></span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I made a reaserch about domain driven design approach to understand it better. The approach had similar concepts we were taught in the 1st to 3rd year level in the applications development subjects. I knew it would be difficult for me to understand the problem that was assigned to me, so getting an understanding of the approach we were instructed to utilize was a milestone that I had to archive.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The approach destroys a barrier between software engineers and people in other industries when they work together to solve a problem. If the problem we are solving would be for the health care industry in the real world situation, this approach would provide principles that would magnify the communication between engineers and people working in the health care sector, this includes doctors, nurses amd other people in the health care industry.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">By implementing domain driven design, I learned that one of its core principles is to foster great communation which leads to the creation of a satisfactory product. The principle of communication is called the Ubiquitous language in domain driven design approach, in simple terms this language is a language understood by both the engineers and the doctors, this includes the employee, doctors, the appointment, medicine. This forces the engineers to deeply understand the health care industry before implementing a possible solution.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">One of the important principles I learned was that domain driven design is used to create software which mimicks the real world objects of the problem being solved.</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Result</span></span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I was tasked with researching the department and employee of a hospital and how they could specifically be addressed in the context of domain driven design. As shown on the artefact <em>uml diagram for planning a hospital appointment app</em>, I collected the attributes that make up an employee and a department. An employee has a name, surname, age, date of birth ets, and a department would have a unique id and a name, the id would be used to identify that department and the users that belong to it in the system of the appointment application. This shows that domain driven design models the application according to the structure of the real world objects of the problem being solved, in this context the objects are the employee and the department.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">From the assignment I learned how to use domain driven design to solve a specific problem. How to create meaningful and stable applications that can serve the best interest of the people in whose industry it is created for.</span></p>

 <h3 class="section-title">2. Personal Progress Mark Application Evidence and Reflection</h3>
 <h3><a href='3_2_1/pa1.html' target='_blank' class='autoClickOnArtifactPreview'>GitHub - Code of personal progress mark application</a></h3>

 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Situation</span></strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">As a student it is my responsibility to keep track of my course progress mark. In the last 3 years of my undergraduate program it has been difficult to keep track of my progress marks, the marks are spread accross blackboard and Student Online Services(SOS). Sometimes they take too long to be finalized, as such I took it upon myself to use the skills I learned of web development to design and create a web application that I can use to keep track of my progress marks for all the courses I enrolled for.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I decided to create this application so that I can use it even when I am offline or want to quickly verify my marks.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Task</span></strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I created a student course progress mark tracking application. One of the skills used was Vue JS, a JavaScript programming language framework technology that is used to create progressive single page web applications. </span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I self taught myself this skill during my second year of study. The use of the application is captured on the artifact&nbsp;<em>Personal Progress mark application</em>. I uploaded the images showing steps on how I use the application to make my life easier. The application relies on 4 inputs to display a progress mark, mainly the subject, the progress mark, mark left, and the pass mark.</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Action</span></span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I created the student personal progress mark tracking web application on my second year of study, I decided to build this web application after having difficulties with tracking my progress mark accross various student platforms provided by the institution. Blackboard only shows marks obtained from course assignments, but not complete calculated course progress marks. So as students we mostly calculate our progress marks.&nbsp;</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The web application uses the four inputs mainly subject, progress mark mark left and pass mark to calculate and display a subject with a calculated progress mark. The application can have multiple subjects added to it. Once a subject is added to the web application I can edit the marks, delete or reset the web application to remove all the subjects and their marks.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">To make the application accesible to potential employees and developers who would be interested in hiring or working with me I uploaded the web application code files to GitHub, a software version control system where developers share their company or personal projects. This is the link to the application code files:</span></p>

 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Result</span></strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I used the application to keep track of my 3rd year progress mark for all my subjects. The web application made my life easier. I can check my progress mark offline, update my marks when the lecturer gives feedback of outstanding marks and monitor my marks quicker to see which subjects need more attention in terms of progress.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Building this web application showed significant improvements to my development career. The improvements are, being able to Identify a problem, creating a solution and Creating meaningful applications that make my life easier. I have been using the application and improving it if I find errors or find the need to add updates that can give the web application more features.</span></p>
