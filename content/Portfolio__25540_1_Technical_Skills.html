<div class="vtbegenerated"> 
 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Situation</span></span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">In my 3rd year of study, I evaluated my web development skills. I realised my potential to make a difference with my skills and make a name for myself. I wanted to make extra income while I am studying, so I started freelancing. I created a portfolio website to showcase my skills and projects. The website has been used as evidence for my previous work to people who are interested in my services.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Task</span></strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Using my web development skills to build a personal portfolio website that can be used as a way to showcase my skills and previous projects completed for clients.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The aim of creating this website was due to the fact that in order to be a succesful freelance web developer in the web development field you have to have a portfolio that has your best projects for different clients with different needs.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Action</span></strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I created a website portfolio to showcase my web development projects and skills to potential clients who would be interested in my services. As a student it is difficult to manage work and studying at the same time, in order to reduce the pressure of working full time, I decided to become a part-time freelance web developer.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I built the website using React Js, a JavaScript language web devlopment framework for building single page applications. Single page web applications unlike old websites, do not use multiple web pages, instead they uses a single web page to switch to different content of a website, they have an ability to avoid reloading a page everytime a user clicks on a link and they have an advantage in being used to build and ship websites quicker.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I compiled a list of my best projects from clients and personal projects. This can be found on the projects page link. A list of my skills but refered to as services on the website can be found on the services page. The website does not reload a page everytime a link to another page is clicked, this is one of the advantages of single page applications. These features can be found on the artifact <em>Personal portfolio website.</em></span></p> 
 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Result</span></span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">After building the website I uploaded it to the GitHub platform were developers share thier code. The platform has a free feature that allows developers to publish thier website. I published my website and it was live and ready to be viewed by potential clients.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I learned from this experience that no skill is ever too insignificant, every skill that I have learned in the field of software engineering can be utilized to make a difference and serve my best interests. I was able to share my website with people who were curious or interested in my web development services. I plan to update the website if I gain more skills and experience in the near future.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">This the link to my personal portfolio website:</span></p>

 <h3 class="section-title">2. Admission Point Score Application Evidence and Reflection</h3>
 <h3><a href='6_2_1/pa1.html' target='_blank' class='autoClickOnArtifactPreview'>Admission Point Score Calculator</a></h3> 
<div class="vtbegenerated"> 
 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>Situation</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">There is diffuculty in applying for admission to various institutions accross South Africa. I noticed this issue while I was applying for admission in my final year in high school. To try and help students who are impacted with the problem, I planned to build a website that can make applying to institutions across South Africa easier.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I planned to build and deploy a website that provides a calculation of admision point score known as APS score to 22 universities in South Africa.</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Task</span></span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Planning and building a website that calculates admission point score of 22 universities accross South Africa. The website also provides a link for applying to each institution.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">There are many websites which perform a similar task, but what made my website unique was that it was claculating the APS score of 22 universities from a single entry of entered results all at once, and diplay the results to the student.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Action</span></strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I built the web application using React Js, a JavaScript language frame work for building single page applications. I made a research about the calculation of the admission point score in South African Universities. One of the key points in my research was finding out how each institution calculates its own admission point score. Each institution in South Africa has its own minimum requirements for admission point score calculation. I had to tailor the application to use the student matric results to output results according to each institutions requirements. </span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The inputs of the application are the matric 7 subject mark percentages. No further information was required as the website does not save any information.</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Result</span></span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I built and deployed the web application for students to use it. I learned a skill regarding the deployment of websites so deploying the website was easier. The features of the website was asking the student to provide results of 7 best subjects and click the calculate button and have the admission point score of each institution displayed to them. The output of the admission point score is displayed with a link to the institutions application link, this is to solve the problem of students spending too much money on data navigating different websites looking for application links.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I shared the website on different social media platforms encouraging students to use it. I also used google analytics to track the users that visit the website.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I could not deploy the website further due to lack of funds, but I plan to update, add more features and deploy once more in the near future. The artifact&nbsp;<em>Admission point score calculator&nbsp;</em>has images demonstrating how the web application works.</span></p>
