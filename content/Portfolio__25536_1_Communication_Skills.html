<div class="vtbegenerated"> 
 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>Situation</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: arial , helvetica , sans-serif;font-size: 12.0pt;">We were assigned a task in a 3rd year subject called project presentation 3 to create a mock interview by interviewing ourselves showcasing our employerbility skills.&nbsp; My mock interview was based on a software development internship position.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Task</span></strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">We were tasked with creating a short video showing employability skills. The video had to show clear, verbal and non verbal aspects of a professional work interview. The video had to be conducted in a good environmnent setting, adhere to proffesional dress code, be short, have clear speech and a good quality.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Action</span></strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I prepared my interview questions beforehand and scouted a good quiet area to perform the interview. I had difficulties asking and answering the questions at the same time, that is were I had to ask someone to help me with the recording and asking the questions of the interview. I selected the best attire and background to make it look profeesional and appealing.</span></p> 
 <span style="font-size: 16.0px;">I made a resaerch about the interview questions that we were provided to find a better way to answer them, one of the best points I learned about a professional interview is answering in a manner that satisfies the question being asked in brief and concise manner. I learned that it is better to prepare for an interview before going ahead with it, so I prepared for the interview by familiarizing myself with the questions.</span>
</div> 
<div class="vtbegenerated"></div> 
<div class="vtbegenerated">
 <span style="font-size: 16.0px;">We were taught how to use proper body language in the 3rd year course of project presentation 3. I tried to abondone as many unecessary movements as possible. I learned from the course that movement and posture play a greater role between the interviewer and the person being interviewed.</span>

 <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Result</span></span></strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I completed the filiming of the interview. I then used a mobile application to compile the video. The video was divided into sections of each question of the interview. I tried the best of my ability to adjust the sound and quality of the interview so that i can be loud and clear.&nbsp;</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The lecturer gave me feedback about the interview, the concerns were the sound and movements. I used too many movements which affected the sound quality. Points taken in this assignment feedback is too avoid too many unecessary movements and make sure I use a high pitch voice to make others hear me.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The process of conducting this interview helped me gain more insights about myself on what I need to improve to be succesful in the future. The artifact to the mock interview can be found above on&nbsp;<em>Mock interview.</em></span></p>

<div class="vtbegenerated"> 
 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>Situation</strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">At Craze Environmental, the company that I am interning for as a software engineer, we use Jira, a web and mobile issue tracking software to schedule issues and progresses of different types of engineering issues in the engineering department. I was introduced to the application so that I can schedule tasks according to the standards of the company. The company uses Jira and Slack to keep up to date with the latest progress on each task in engineering department.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Task</span></strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Scheduling and assigining a task to myself or a team member. New tasks, tasks requiring a review, tasks in progress and tasks done need be monitored and added to an appropriate row once their status has changed.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I had a short meeting with the project manager so that he can demonstrate how I can get started with Jira.</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Action</span></span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I followed the project manager step by step on how to use the Jira web application. He taught me how to open a new task, move a task to a new progress status, review status and done status.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I added a task called fix cart item removal. A task that required me to add a functionality of adding and removing items from a shopping cart, this is from the artifact <em>Remove cart item functionality</em>. After completing the task I moved it to the section of review to be reviewed by the lead engineer. After the review I added the task to the completed section, as seen on artifact <em>Task done from Jira </em>and <em>Jira issue tracking product</em>.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The application is helpful in figuring out the best prioritization of tasks and keeping track of assigned tasks belonging to different team members in the engineering department.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Result</span></strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I gained confidence in using the application. I started assigning more tasks to myself and other team members in the engineering department.The CEO encouraged me to download the application on my phone to get the latest updates from the engineering team.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Learning how to use the Jira application improved the level of communication I had with the engineering team, keeping track of software engineering tasks is cumbersome when using basic applications like whatsApp or other basic communication medias.</span></p>
