 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Situation</span></strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">During my internship at Craze environmental, I was tasked with updating the design of a web application. The web application was part of a project that is aimed at promoting the iniative towards a clean and safe environment. The web application was going to be given to other stakeholders of the company to test it, so that we can get feedback.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I noticed that the design task that was assigned to me was a minor task that needed less attention than the remaining tasks of the web application. So I requested the CEO to allow me to work on the major tasks. This was because these tasks were the ones that were going to be tested the most and receive more feedback. These tasks were updating the quantity of a product in a shopping cart and removing a product from the cart.</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Task</span></span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Requesting the CEO to allow me to transition from one task to the other. I requested the transition so that I can focus on tasks that were more important and needed more attention.&nbsp;</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I also requested the CEO to allow me to delegate my task of designing the user interface to another team member. I communicated with the CEO and later sent a communication to the other team member. I asked him if he can either work on the design or work on the tasks that I highlghted to the CEO that they need more attention.</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Action</span></span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I worked on the design of a user interface for the company's web application. The web application was closer to being deployed and tested. The most important thing after the deployment of the web application would be the feedback of the stakeholders. The stakeholders were employees from other departments of the company. We would use their feedback in determing which features should be added and updated.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I noticed that while the design of the user interface maybe important, the other tasks which were removing a product from the cart and updating the quantity of a particular product would be tested the most by the stakeholders. That is were I had to make a decision to request the CEO in assigning me these tasks and delegate the task of designing the user interface to another team member, the request can be found on the artifact <em>Prioritizing and delegation of tasks</em>.</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Result</span></span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">After communicating with the CEO, he approved my decision and imformed me to communicate with the other team member who is going to take over my task of designing the user interface so that I can focus on the functionalities of the shopping cart. The other team member accepted the task that I delegated to him and I continued to work on the shopping cart functionalities. The communication with the other team member is found on the artifact <em>Delegating a task to another team member.</em></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">What I learned from this situation is the prioritization of tasks according to importance and being able to have a clear communication with other team members when making a decision.</span></p>
