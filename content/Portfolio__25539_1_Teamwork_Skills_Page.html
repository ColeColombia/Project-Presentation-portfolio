 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: 12.0pt;">Situation</span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">During the 3rd year of my undergraduate program, we had a subject called Project 3. We were working as a group of 6 to complete a project that was due at the end of the year, at the end of each term we had to submit a milestone as a part of our project progress.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">My team had to select a suitable problem to solve and the problem had to be presented to the supervising lecturer for approval. The supervisor was also responsible for monitoring the project and answering our quiries if we experience any issues.&nbsp; </span></p> 
 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Task</span></strong></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Identifying a problem in any industry to solve, make a research if the problem can be solved using technology we learned and present the problem to the supervisor to convince her that the problem identified is concrete and can be solved. To start working on the project we would need the approval of the supervisor concerning the feasibility of the project.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">After getting approval from the supervisor we would start brainstorming the project and identify the role of each member on the project.</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Action</span></span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">I met with the rest of the team in the beginning of the year to discuss our project solution after getting approval from the supervisor. Each team member had already aquired different tech skills that can be contributed to the project. Since we had different skills we had a conflict on which skills to use for the project. The team leader selected skills that he was familiar with to work on the project, I saw this as a problem that would impact other team members and myself. I suggested we select technologies that all team members are familiar with. The team leader agreed to use technologies that everyone is familiar with. We discussed other technologies that we did not have knowledge of, and wanted to learn them together in order to contribute to the project.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The team leader suggested possible problems we could solve, one of the problems was building a project for a pet health care system. I agreed with the selection of this problem because I had worked on a similar project before, but as an individual. The aim of the pet health care system website was to help people mitigate different diseases that may impact thier pets and find a specific health care near by that addresses that specific pet.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"> On GitHub, a source code version control system for maintaining and sharing code online, the team leader opened a new profile for the project so that the team members can get a copy of the project and start contributing. The team members and our contribution can be found on the artifact<em> GitHub contribution</em> above.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">My roles and responsibilities were the fetching of relevant animals from the database, adding displaying and filtering features.</span></p> 
 <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Result</span></span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The team members contributed to the project according to their roles and we were able to complete the project in record time. But we faced obstacles, these obstacles pushed us to learn new skills, we learned a skill called pivoting, this is a skill that is used mostly in software engineering. Pivoting occurs when certain goals or mission of a solution changes or becomes unfeasible to achieve. So we changed most of our goals. The goals that impacted our project the most was the addition of a google calendar and a map, in order to have these features added to any project we would need to register with google and be subject to being billed by google for using their services. So the team was having disputes on who should open an account with their banking details. One of the team members compromised and opened the account, then we were able to start working on the features.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The website had features such as searching for a specific animal, selecting an animal, display animals according to different breeds, selecting an animal and selecting its symptoms, the symptoms would be used to&nbsp; figure out the underlying diseases. These features can be found on the artifact <em>Pet health care application</em> above.</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">This project had a significant impact on my team working skills, communication and problem solving skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
